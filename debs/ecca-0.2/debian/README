The Eccentric Authentication package
------------------------------------

Eccentric Authentication is a way to create client certificates for your
users without violating their privacy.

It allows users to sign up for a certificate with nothing more than a 
nickname. The Eccentric CA check if the nickname is unique and signs the 
certificate.

The user can use the certificate to log in to your website.

It gives your users trust that they are the only one using their chosen 
on your site while keeping their real identities for themselves.

It gives site operators a way to distinguish between individual users
without the hassles with passwords. In fact, there are no passwords, nor
email address stored on the site, reducing a big security and privacy risk.

This package contains the web-application that does the signing.
