<h1>Register</h1>

<p>This site uses Eccentric Authentication. Instead of passwords we
use cryptographic certificates to create an account.

<p>It may sound complicated but with the right web browser, such as a
modern Firefox, it's even easier than registering a password. Just
create a username. If it is still free, it's yours. Please note, it
will published on the page together with your favorite number, so
don't use your email address or real name if you don't want. It can be
anything you like.

<form method="POST" action="https://register.ecca.wtmnd.nl/register-spkac">
  <label>Username: </label><input type="text" name="cn"><br>
  <keygen name="spkac" challenge="none" keytype="rsa"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Register">
</form>

<h4>Supported web browsers</h4>

<p>Eccentric Authentication uses modern key certificate
technologies. Many browsers can handle certificates. But not many make
it easy to do so. 
<br>
If your browser doesn't generate the key you should really try Firefox.
