<h1>Explanation</h1>

<p>This site uses Eccentric Authentication. Instead of passwords it
uses cryptographic certificates to create accounts.

<h4>The problems with passwords</h4>

Too easy to crack, too difficult to remember, too many of them.....

<h4>Eccentric Authentication</h4>

Eccentric Authentication (Ecca) is a protocol to replace password
authentication with client certificates. By doing so we can:
<ul>
<li> make it easier to login and log out of web sites;</li>
<li> make it anonymous; you can sign up to site without providing
     any details that would tie the account to your person;</li>
<li> make communication more secure; with certificates, people can send
     encrypted and signed messages securely without revealing their
     identities. Ideal for a dating site;</li>
<li> make it possible to bootstrap other communication protocols securely.</li>
</ul>

<p>If applied correcty, Ecca would take us out of the cryptographic bronze
age into the silver age. From there we might lift ourselves into the
golden age.

<h2>What Eccentric Authentication does not</h2>

<h4>Email address identity</h4>

I have my own domain that I use it as my primary email
address. My email address is therefore a synonym for my real name. That,
in turn implies that every account that is linked to my email addres
is tied to my real world identity.

<p>With my use of SPF to prevent spammers from abusing my email
address I have less opportunity to repudiate (to lie) about the origin
of a message that I might regret at a later date. I must therefore be
very careful with what I write and blog about at any site that knows
my email address.

<p>I would hazard a guess that most email addresses are tied to real
world identities given the pervasiveness of data tracking and
profiling.

<h4>Fully validated certificates</h4>

A fully validated global CA certificate is a digital identity tied to
your real world identity. 

<p>When you use a fully validated certificate, all your actions and
messages are tagged with your real identity, for life.

<p>These certificates have good use for situations where people need
to identify someone by name. For example a public notary who transfers
the title of a house. Or government employees who are applying laws to
grant or deny requests. You need accountability, so these people have
no expectation of privacy in these roles.

<p>It doesn't mean that the notaries or civil servants don't have any
right to privacy at all. On the contrary, in their personal lives,
privacy is as important to them as to any one else.

<p>Ecca doesn't replace fully validated global certificates. And it
shouldn't. While Google could apply Ecca for its gmail service, it
should not use it for their @google.com domain. You don't want
anyone on the net to claim they work at google.

<h4>Lousy validated certificates</h4>

<p>A Lousy Validated Certificate is a certificate that is validated on
shaky grounds. Most likely, the <i>"validation"</i> means
<i>"control"</i> of an email address. 

<p>It's neither meat nor fish. These certificates are good for
nothing. They water the trust we can have in fully validated
certificates without providing any strong identity claim nor do they
proved sufficient privacy. They should go away. With Ecca, there is no
need for these anymore.

<h4>Not Persona/BrowserID</h4>

Mozillas Persona/BrowserID is a Federated Identity Management system
with a Lousy Validated certificate based upon email "validation". No
Thanks.

<h4>Yet-Another-Account</h4>

What the Y-A-A problem actually is, is a roadblock that web site
owners impose upon their visitors. As the internet is mostly
anonymous in nature, site owners want to recognize return visitors. 

<p>On itself the login procedure is not too taxing but with so many sites
requiring it, it becomes a burden. 

<p>When a site requires an email address for a validation email, or to
send password reset messages, it ties the account to the email
identity and from there to the meat space identity. It can be a high
price for a comment on a blog.

<p>Often times, too much of a burden that visitors turn away, never to return. 

<p>While there are ways to get a temporary email address at an anonymity
provider, using these increases the burden.

<p>Use of Ecca with proper browser support can solve the Y-A-A problem.

<h2>What makes Eccentric Authentication different.</h2>

<h4>Password replacement</h4>

Eccas first purpose is a system to manage an account at a site. It
replaces the hassles that come with passwords. It provides the user
with a method to register at the site and later log in to it. The
site can recognise the user at later visits.

<h4>No third party</h4>

Users request a certificate <em>from the site</em> where they want to sign up
to. Users do not have to deal with any third party. The site itself
runs the certificate signer. Every site signs the certificates only
for it's own site. With the certificate and the private key, the user
can log in to the site.

<h4>No identity validations</h4>

An Ecca signer does not validate identities before signing a
certificate.  Ecca has only one requirement, the username must be
unique at the site. The owner of the private key controls the use of
the account at the site.

<p>At different sites you create different accounts. No need to share the
identity at one to another site.

<h4>Benefits</h4>

This simple set up already gives us some benefits:
<ul>
<li> no more weak passwords, people can't memorize strong passwords anyway;</li>

<li> no more lost passwords, browsers will handle that with the help of
  cloud backup and synchronisation;</li>

<li> on the server side, there is no need to store a username/password
  database. As soon as the certificate is signed, it contains all
  details needed to proces logins</li>

<li> without a password database, there are no user credentials to
  steal from the site. Security requirements are simpler (for simple
  sites). If you would gather more privacy sensitive user data from
  your users, your security requirements would increase
  accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The end of Yet-Another-Account</h4>

With Ecca certificates we can end the dreaded Yet-Another-Account
roadblock.

<p>We solve it by creating even more accounts. But we make account
creation completely automatic. All it requires is <em>one click</em> from the
user to sign up when he <em>decides</em> to register.

<h4>User Agent</h4>

<p>Let me introduce the Ecca plug in. It is a browser plug in that
takes care of all the crypto-details to make sure people do not have
to do rsa-calculations by head. :-)

<p>The plug in has the properties that it can: <ul>
<li> recognize the site (via web-domain);</li>
<li> recognize whether a certificate is needed (a http-return code) 
  and log in with a certificate;</li>
<li> handle the whole certificate process automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to use the Ecca plug in</h4>

<p>When you browse to a site that requires you to create an account, the
plug in (not the site) gives you two buttons:<ul>
<li> "Sign up"; it asks for a username and performs the registration; </li>
<li> "Sign up anonymous": it creates a random username and signs up with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>As soon as you have pressed the button, the browser will create the
certificate request and ask the the sites' own CA to sign it. Then the plug
in logs you in with the freshly signed certificate.

<p> It takes less than a second to register and log in. And, as you
didn't provide any personal details it leaves no identifiable
information about you at the site. You have logged in secure and
anonymous.

<p><em>Notice, it is the plug in that shows the buttons, does the account
creation and login, not the site. There is not even a log in page on
the site.</em>

<p>When you later browse to the site again, the plug in recognizes the
site, remembers the account and offers you to log in with the
previously generated certificate. Just click on the button.

<p>You could even tell your browser to always log you in when you
navigate there. 

<p>The user can also create multiple accounts a single site. For example,
at a blog site, a user can write about parenting and politics under
different identities while the plugin takes care of the identity
and session management. (and onion routing).

<p>The plug in also offers a log out button that ends the authenticated
session so later visits to the site are anonymous again. It also needs
to delete all session data, like cookies, caches and so on.

<p>If there is a need, there could even be a "Na-Na-Na"-button in the
plug in that creates a random username, uses it for the current session
and deletes the key and certificate directly afterwards. This gives
you a completely new identity every time you visit the
site. 

<p><em>Certificates are cheap. Use them aplenty.</em>

<h4>Adoption</h4>

<p>Right now, site owners might not be so happy to allow Ecca
certificates. It gives the visitor the freedom to choose under which
username to log in at any time, while staying anonymous as long as
they want. But I don't give them much choice.

<p>With a good plug in, it's easier for visitors to use certificates
than to create an account and password manually. This could nugde site
owners to migrate towards Ecca. It is up to them to come up
with a compelling reason for their visitors to sign up with an
identity and keep using it.



<h2>Why certificates</h2>

Most of the benefits I described above can also be reached with other
mechanisms.
 
<p>There is a compelling argument why I choose certificates:

<p><em>a certificate is an identity that can be addressed</em>

<p>Users can point to each other on the site by their chosen
usernames. In fact, someone created an account called 'cc' at this
site. I don't know who did. All I have is an IP-address in my server
logs. And that could be VPN-address or an onion routed address.

<p>When he created the account, the browser genrated a private key
that matches the public key in the certificate.

<p>Anyone can fetch this certificate with:
<pre>
   wget --no-check-certificate -O cc.cert \
      'https://register.ecca.wtmnd.nl/get-certificate?nickname=cc'
</pre>

<p>From there, you can retrieve the public key from the certificate
and validate messages from 'cc' or encrypt messages to send to
'cc'. It's is just like any other use of a client certificate except
that you can communicate securely and anonymously with a complete stranger.

<p>There is a difference, Ecca only provide the identity, it doesn't
deal with messaging. It leaves it up to the sites to deal with
that. Here's an example how a dating site could handle it.


<h4>Example, a dating site</h4>

A dating site lets people register with ecca-certificates. The
certificate is used for access control to the site and to allow
members to write encrypted personal messages to other dating members. A
browser plug in takes care of the encryption details, the dating site
takes care of delivery. When you receive a reply, the certificate
tells you that it is indeed from the person you wrote to.

<p>As the messages are encrypted with the recipients public key, the
dating site can not read them. At all. As it should be.

<p>Would a member of the site behave unappropriately, the person
complaining can file this complaint at the site, revealing the signed
messages and when the dating site operators agree, the offenders' account
gets closed.

<p>The account gets closed by blacklisting the certificate at the
site. The certificate stays valid but the site won't allow neither log
in nor message delivery, which requires log in. The only option for
the offender is to open a new account and pay the membership fees
again if he wants to try to contact the same person again.

<p>As long as the complaining person did not reveal any other identities,
the offender cannot reach this person anymore.
 
<p>When the communication between the dating site members becomes
physical, both unsubscribe at the site to make their profile
unavailable and then delete their private key and certificate to hide
any trail of messages. 

<p>Would the offender ever use that certificate for communication in a
way that requires him to go public with his real world identity, he
gives the Person-of-Interest an ability to blackmail him with his past
behaviour. It's in his best interest to delete the certificate and the
private key that he used in bad manners and use a new identity (most
likely from another site).

<h4>Trust considerations</h4>

<p>When you decide to hand your money to the dating site for a chance to
meet people of interest, you've made a trust-decision. 

<p>You decide to join the site based upon recommendations from people
you know. You wouldn't make that decision because the server
certificate is signed by some certificate authority.

<p>It's the other way around: <em>The site-owners better makes sure
their cryptography is in order or they will be hanged at the gallows
of the internet for being unreliable.</em>

<p>And if they turn out to be crooks, you only lost some money, not
your real world identity. (You did pay in bitcoin didn't you?)


<h2>Human readable cryptographic identities</h2>

I mentioned that the identity consists of two parts. One part is the
username. The other part is the site name.

<p>There is a one-to-one mapping between usernames at a site and
certificates it has signed. The username is a human-readable
identifier for the certificate. Given a username for a site, you can
retrieve the certificate that enables you to establish a secure
channel.

<p>As each site has its own CA, there is a one-to-one mapping between
site names and CA-certificates. When you have the site's
CA-certificate you can validate each username.

<p>What we need is a way that allows to trust that mapping.

<p>There is the solution: it's called DNSSEC with DANE. With DANE, the
site owner can specify the CA-certificate of his site. DNSSEC secures
that statment cryptographically.

<p>As user, you can refer to a site by its site name look up both the
IP-address and the site CA certificate.

<p>Trust, but verify

<p>With mechanisms such as CMU Perspectives, Moxie Marlinspikes'
Convergence, Chrome Certificate Pinning, Certificate Patrol plug in,
Petname plug in and probably a dozen other, we have ways to detect
tampering with the DNSSEC key chains from the DNS root to the site.

<h4>End run around Zooko's triangle.</h4>

<p>Once we can reach sufficient trust in DNSSEC it allows us to create
a secure mapping from site name to the sites' CA certificate. That, in
turn gives us the trust in the mapping from user names to certificates
signed by the site.

<p>With that chain of trust in place, you can call your girlfriend on
the phone and mention one of your ecca-identities. She types it in and
her user agent retrieves the correct certificate. Using an insecure
channel (the phone), you have transfered your public key safely to her
computer to bootstrap a secure channel (ZRTP VOIP) where you
can talk <strike>dirty</strike>, ehm, private things.

<p>Just spell the name: <em>cc [at] ecca.wtmnd.nl.</em>



<br><br><br><hr>

<p>I do believe that once critical mass is achieved every site will
accept Ecca and passwords will be a memory.
