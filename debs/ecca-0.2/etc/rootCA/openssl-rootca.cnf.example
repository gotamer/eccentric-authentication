#
# Eccentric Authentication Root Certificate Authority.
#
#
# This is the OpenSSL configuration file for the Root Certificate of your EcCA system.
# It is used to generate the server certificates for your services, such as web services.
#
# And it is used to generate the certficates for the SubCA that signs the clients.
#
# The security of the whole system depends on the secrecy of the private key of this CA.
# You are encouraged to use a smart card to store the key. You only need it when you sign
# a new server certificate or a new SubCA certificate. Both happen only every once in a
# while.


## Here lives your rootCA

## Please use debconf and postinst to set these.
