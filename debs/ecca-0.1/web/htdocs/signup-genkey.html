<h1>Register for [ecca.localhost]</h1>

<h2>Welcome to [localhost].</h2>

<p>To access the site, you are requested to sign up here.

<p><form method="post" action="/register-spkac">
<label>Username: </label><input type="text" name="cn"><br>
<keygen name="spkac" challenge="none" keytype="rsa"><br>
<input type="submit" value="Register">
</form>

<h2>Choose a nickname</h2>
<p>First, think of the nickname you want to use at [localhost]. It's the way we (and the others here) will know you.
<p>There is only one requirement: it must be different from all the other usernames at the site. You can test it here: https://check-name-available?name=YourUsername. We will make nice javascript button for that later.
