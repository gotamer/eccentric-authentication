<h3>Welcome to the Favorite Number Site</h3>

<p>Welcome to the favorite number site. Here you can share your
favorite number with the world. 

<p>Take a look at the current most <a href="/show">favorite</a> numbers.

<p>Everyone can come and visit the site. Reading is open for
everyone. Writing is limited to members only. Imagine the mess if
everyone could write anything.

<p>To become a member, all you have to do
is <a href="register.html">register</a>. You choose the username you wish to have
and your browser must come up with some cryptographic bits to make it secure. With
Firefox, that is easy. It does the all the difficult cryptographic
work for you.

<p>After registering, you can log in with the cryptographic bits and
safely share your favorite number to the world.

<p>Does your favorite number change over time, feel free to come back
and change it. You could even update it like the weather. Just let
your browser log you in with the cryptographic bits and update your
number.

<h3>No joke</h3>

<p>Well, a site to show off favorite numbers is a joke. What's not a
joke is the technology behind the registration and log in pages. It's
the worlds easiest Client Certificate system.

<p>Its called Eccentric Authentication. For more information, see
the <a href="explanation.html">Explanation page</a>.
